# Purrquinox

Purrquinox is a start-up focused on creating meaningful, practical solutions to real problems. Whether it's tools to enhance community safety or projects that make workflows easier, we put our energy into building things that work and help others. This website focuses on showcasing our projects and providing resources for those interested in learning more about what we do. We believe in the power of technology to make a difference, and we're excited to share our journey with you.

# Tech Stack

Our website utilizes many cutting-edge technologies to provide a seamless user experience. The front-end is built with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and Next.js, a framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation. We utilize Tailwind CSS for styling, which allows us to create responsive and modern designs quickly. We utilize Framer Motion for animations, which adds a layer of interactivity to our website. With our tech stack, we can create a fast, responsive, and visually appealing website that showcases our projects and resources effectively for you.
